# 👋 Hai, I'm Hanari
🧑‍🚀I am a Computer Science undergraduate student (currently in 2nd semester)<br>
  who is currently exploring the fundamentals of programming and technology.<br>
  My main interest lies in **Python and Machine Learning**, and I am actively building my knowledge step by step.

---
##  🎯 Focus & Interests
🧠My current focus is on developing a solid foundation in **Python programming**<br>
  while gradually exploring the fundamentals of **Machine Learning** supported by mathematics such as calculus and linear algebra.<br>
  I am also building skills in **data processing, algorithmic thinking**, and problem solving<br>
  with a continuous learning mindset to prepare myself for more advanced areas in computer science.<br>
  
✨Beyond technology, I am genuinely interested in **Space and Astronomy** and Anime or Light Novel,<br>
  and I believe it is valuable to share this curiosity so please don’t hesitate to start a conversation with me.
